# Selfing is the safest sex for *Caenorhabditis tropicalis*

This repo contains data and code for construction and analysis of *C. tropicalis* genetic maps, variant calling in wild isolates, and population genetic simulations, accompanying the [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.242032v1.full).

Genetic map and variant calling pipelines use [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Dependencies are listed in the `init.sh` files (for virtual environments on the NYU HPC cluster).
